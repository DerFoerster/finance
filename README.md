     Practical
          Use more panda Dataframe              -> branch pandaization
          Compute for several charts parallel   -> branch parallelization
          Implement own datatype for sde-models -> branch typization
          Implement Black-Scholes as exercise   -> branch sde -> black_scholes
          Implement ARCH for application        -> branch sde -> garch
          Implement GoGARCH or CoGARCH          -> branch sde -> cogarch
          
     Theoretical
	  Implement Black-Scholes as exercise
	  Understand GARCH
	  Understand GOGARCH
	  Understand COGARCH
	  Understand how one can determine parameters for such models from data
	  Understand how one can solve such models
	  Understand hypothesis tests
	  Understand how one can make a hypothesis test for light- or heavy-tailed distributions
	  Understand how one can make a hypothesis test for variation stuff of some models
	  Understand how one can give some confidence-interval for chart-models
